        <h2>Design Study: Planet Fitness</h2>
        <p>Planet Fitness is an application mainly for the users who are enrolled as a member of the Planet Fitness gym while non-enrolled members can also use this app if they want to know about the club and various exercises.</p>

        <h4 class="work-h4">Project Overview</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>The project was to do a design study on any mobile application that we use but do not like that much from the UX prospective, which was given by my professorfor the “Advanced User Experienec” class.</p>
        </div>

         <h4 class="work-h4">Problem</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>The app has many useful features but there is a lot of confusion while using the app as the user sometimes has to go deep enough to book a slot at the club and the icon for checking in the club is really confusing, it seems to be saved files. Also, there is redundancy in some features such as scan & learn inbox. There is a 'set up profile' button in the hamburger menu which is totally different from the name, it is all about the user's target or goals that they want to achieve from the gym. </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="work-h4">User Flow and Wireframes</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>I created the new user flow solving the issues that I figured out to keep it simple and easy to use for the users. Below is the current user flow and the proposed user flow.</p>

        <h4 class="work-h4">Wireframes</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>I created the wireframes using the user flow that I created. I tried to make it consistent with the current application as much as possible but simpler and easier to use.
Below are the images of the original application along with the proposed wireframes.</p>

        <h4 class="work-h4">Home Page of the application</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <ul>
            <li>The icon for check-in is changed and the name is added to let the users know what it is all about. Users can check in and book a slot in the club for any day and time.</li>

<li> "Refer" is replaced with "settings" which also includes "profile" which was earlier under the hamburger at the top left corner. </li>

<li> "Refer" is added to the home page at the bottom as a button.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>"Free workouts" is renamed as "Trainer's advice" to reduce the confusion for the user as it contains the trainer's videos to give advice to the users.</li>

<li>Back button for the user to make it easy to go back instead of pressing the 'workouts' icon again and then going back.</li>

<li>The search box is added to make it easy for the user to search for any video.</li>

<li>The filter button is placed at the top instead of the bottom. At the bottom, it disappeared when the user scrolls, now the user can easily press it than earlier.</li>

<li>The scroll bar is added to let users know that there are more videos at the bottom.
