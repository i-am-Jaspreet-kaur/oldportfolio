        <div class="work-para">
          <p>I used this website for my design study for UI. I chose this because the website has less contrast and the font size was too smaal to read.</p>
        </div>

         <h4 class="work-h4">Problem</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>The website has low contrast at the header and footer and the font size of the text is too low to read. The headings have stroke over it which is confusing for the user that it is clickable, same with the services that the company provides, when the user hover over the icons they seem to be clickable.</p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="work-h4">UI Kit</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>I replaced the yellow color with Spanish orange as the yellow color is used for caution. Spanish Orange is more energetic than yellow. I used Cyan Cobalt Blue instead of green for the search bar as the green color is mixed with the background image a little bit. There are some icons for the menu, and I created other menu options that are without icons. I changed the font type to raleway instead of Roboto as Raleway is a good legibility and has 9 weights.</p>

        <h4 class="work-h4">Mockups</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>I created the Mockups using the UI Kit that I created and also made some changes as per UX in order to align the pages and make it consistent. Below are the images of the Mockups along with the original images.</p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="work-h4">Home Page</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>I increased the font size for the header and changed the background color to make it a good contrast with the white color of the font. I used Spanish orange as the background color for the menu and white color for the text which is a good contrast. I removed the stroke over the headings and I Propose the icons be stable for the facilities that the company offers as they seem to be clickable. I made the payment options’ icons colorful instead of black and white to make it clear for the users.</p>

<p>For the search Section on the top, I gave Spanish Orange color to the bar that is selected and light grey to the other one which is not selected to make it easy for the users that where they are. For “Shop by the tire size”, I tried to make it consistent with the “Shop by Vehicle”.</p>

<p>I gave more padding for the cards under “Shop Accessories”. I also centre aligned the “Featured Makes” to make the page consistent.

        <h4 class="work-h4">Summer Tires Page</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>For the Summer Tires under “Tires” Menu, I put the heading with the icon on the left and gave more spacing on the top and bottom. </p>

<p>The filters on the left moves up when the user scrolls the screen, I propose to make this section static. Also, the Dropdown icon with the filters is jus there but does not work which confuses the users that it is clickable. I made this icon clickable. For the Mobile Version, I showed the Filters at the top and made the heading clickable that it will open / close when clicked rather than do not show the filters on the same screen.</p>

<p>For the Cards for Desktop Version, I centre aligned the name of the tires and placed under the image and placed the reviews and other information on the top left. I gave more padding for the cards. </p>

<p>For the cards for Mobile Version, I placed the Name on the top to the right side of the image and the reviews and other information below it to make the cards horizontal instead of vertical.</p>
