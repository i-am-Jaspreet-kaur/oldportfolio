        <h4 class="work-h4">Problem</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>British Columbia is home to the highest biodiversity in North America and has more than tens of thousands of plants in a rich ecosystem. It is very difficult to find out about them easily on the internet as it is very elaborated and a long list which took so much time to figure out the right information.</p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="work-h4">Solution</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>Our solution is a web app that compiles all information about our flora, where each tree or flower has a profile with photos and relevant information. People can use a search feature to type the data they are looking for, or use the filters to narrow down information and even add the plants to their library. </p>

        <div class="work-para">
          <p>Me and my fellow desginers created the user flow to start with the application. After finalising the features with the developers, i created the mobile version of the wireframes after the lead designer completed the desktop version. The main focus was to create the simple and clean wireframes to make the user-interaction easy.</p>
