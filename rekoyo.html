        <h4 class="work-h4">Problem</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>Research says that retirement can result in anxiety and stress and can be boring. Retired do not have anyone to talk to as everyone is busy in their lives. They are skilled and have lots of experience which they would like to share with others, especially youngsters to give them the right direction as they have a lack of direction these days, but there is no such platform where both generations can easily connect. </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="work-h4">Solution</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>Retired people can utilize their free time to help youngsters on topics they need help with, this way they will not feel alone and share their experiences with them to give them the right direction. </p>

          <p>REKOYO provides the solution to both youngsters and retired/experienced to connect with each other to take guidance and share their experiences. Users can connect and chat with each other for easy communication and help. They can refer the users to others to help them.</p>

        <h4 class="work-h4">User Flow and Wireframes</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>The team decided on all the features keeping in mind all the problems faced by the users so that we can solve those with the help of our application. I created the user flow with the team member’s help keeping in mind easy interaction for the user. After the user flow, We created the wireframes and kept them simple and easy for the users to interact with, that the text is easily readable.</p>

        <h4 class="work-h4">UI Kit and Logo</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>We used medium electric blue as primary with Spanish orange as secondary color because these colors represent importance and confidence (blue) and give energy and cheer you up (orange). Another reason to use blue as the primary color is that it has good contrast with white color and the orange color is bright which we used for text that is clickable to catch the users’ attention.</p>

<p>We used the geometric sans serif Montserrat typeface because of its good X-height and easy readability.</p>

<p>I created the icons with round edges and used the buttons with icons keeping in mind that these can be easily recognizable by the users. The logo is created using the same color palette with a lighter shade of blue and a gradient, white background, and text with Montserrat font type and kept lowercase to make the logo simple, bright, and eye-cathcing.</p>

<p>The logo of the application is created keeping in mind its main feature “Connection”, I created the connect icon first using a circle and three users representing small filled circles which as a whole represents the users connecting with each other as if they are joining their hands. So, the logo is a modification from that icon by removing three small circles and keeping it to a simple circle but broken into two halves so that it looks similar to both ‘O’ and the ring of ‘R’.
