        <div class="work-para">
          <p>Research says that retirement can result in anxiety and stress and can be boring. Retired do not have anyone to talk to as everyone is busy in their lives. They are skilled and have lots of experience which they would like to share with others, especially youngsters to give them the right direction as they have a lack of direction these days, but there is no such platform where both generations can easily connect. </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="work-h4">Solution</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>Retired people can utilize their free time to help youngsters on topics they need help with, this way they will not feel alone and share their experiences with them to give them the right direction. </p>
