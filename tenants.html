        <h4 class="work-h4">Problem</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>Due to the large number of the tenants and their data, it is difficult for the property managers to keep track of their tenant’s record. It is very difficult to keep record of all these having a busy schedule and they might have a large number of properties which can lead to confusion and misplace of some data.</p>

         <h4 class="work-h4">Solution</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>Commudum Lease will help the property owners / managers to keep the record of all the tenant data with all their personal information, payment, contract expiry and create the report of their data. They can also download their report as a pdf.</p>

        <h4 class="work-h4">User Flow and Wireframes</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>I and my team created the userflow of the application to start with the project. This was the team project for the UX class. The team discussed about the features for the application and created the wireframes. I helped the team to create the mobile version of the application after they completed the desktop version for the application.</p>

        <div class="work-para">
          <p>After creating the wireframes with the help of my team, I created theUI kit and the logo for the webite. The logo is basically the “C” letter of Commudum + “L” letter of Lease and the “Home” icon and I combined it in such a way that its outer line completes the circle. I used the Drak Cyan, sunray and Spicy Mix colors as gradient for the logo.</p>
<p>I used Dark Cyan as the primary color with Parrot pink and spicy Mix as secondary colrs for the website. I used Josefin Sans typeface for the website because of its good legibility. I created the icons round edges and used the text to make the users easily understand the icons.</p>
