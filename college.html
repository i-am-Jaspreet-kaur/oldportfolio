        <h4 class="work-h4">Project Overview</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>It is a website of Pacific Link College. I chose this website because the website is too noisy and has so many distractions due to animations. The flow of the website is confusing as it lead the user to same pages when the user clicks on different links such as clicking on the “contact us” menu lead the user to the about us page.I made some changes in the flow of the website and UX/UI both to make it easy to use. </p>
        </div>

         <h4 class="work-h4">Problem</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>The “about us” is in chinese and when the try to translate it into english, the alignment of the page is disturbed and the top navigation disappears.</p>

<p>The career page under “Conact Us” has very few text which is not what the name suggests.</p>

<p>The home page has links that are repetitive and not consistent as per alignment. It has testimonials which is not needed on the home page or should be at the bottom of the page or under any other menu.</p>

<p>Campus and facilities under Current students has further sub-menu: IT Services and when the user clicks on the menu, the page displays the IT Services. So there is no need to divide it into sub-menu. It should be either just “Campus and Facilities” or “IT Services”.</p>

<p>University Pathways under “Partnerships and Pathways” has sub-menus for pathways to different colleges and universities which are small pages with little text. It should be a single page as it’s just 4 sub-menus with little text.</p>

<p>News and Events on Admissions page does not need to be there, it should be under “About Us” page as sub-menu.</p>

<p>Course and Programs menu has dropdown menu which is too large and cover the whole screen. It should be a  different page.</p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="work-h4">User Flow and Wireframes</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>I created new Userflow keeping in mind that the user can easily access the information from the website as it is a college website and created wireframes according to that. I changed the dropdown menu on hover for “Courses and Programs” to a single page instead and moved the news and events from admissiona page to about us page. Below is the proposed userflow along with the current userflow.</p>

        <h4 class="work-h4">UI Kit</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <p>I used the “True Blue” color as primary color at the place of “Oxford Blue” which is used for the top and bottom navigation for the website now. I used the “True Blue” color as when I did Research on the college, I saw the images of the campus from the inside and even for their uniform, they used this color more than the ‘Oxford Blue’ color. So I used this color as primary color for the website to make consistent with their branding. </p>

<p>Though I did not removed Oxford Blue as a whole from the website, I used it as Seconday color and used it for the buttons and headings for the text. </p>

<p>I used “Alice Blue” as Tertiary color and used it as the background color for the contact us form, global partners, tables and cards.</p>

<p>I used white color for the text with true blue as background color and black with white background for the good contrast so that it is easy for the users to read the text clearly.</p>
<p>I used two font type for the website: Serif “Crimson Pro” for the headings and sub headings and open-sourced “Noto sans” for body text because of its legibility and readibility.</p>

        <div class="work-para">
          <p>I created the mockups using the colors and typography for the website. Below are the mockup screen the original images of the website.</p>
        </div>


        <h4 class="work-h4">Home Page</h4>
        <div class="work-para">
          <ul>
            <li>
              I used the college image instead of video as the video makes the page too noisy and distracting.</li>

<li>The text and image on the home page are coming from the both the sides which does not look good. So I proposed it to be stable.</li>

<li>I used an original college photo instead of a moving image on the page.</li>

<li>When the user hover over the image, a colored box appears frrom the left side for “Latest Events” which does not look good. My proposd idea is that the cards enlarge when the user hover over.</li>

<li>I removed the background image to reduce the noise for “Global Partners”.</li>

<li>When the user hover over the text in the footer, it mixes with the background, I proposed to enlarge the text when hover over.</li>

<li>I removed the testimonials and placed these under “Current Students”. I replaced it with the text “why PLC” and “Latest Events”. I placed it before “Global Partners” and “Contact Us” form as it is the information that the user would like to know first.</li>

<li>I made the “Latest Events” vertical instead of horizontal and consistent to each other. This way it is aligned properly with “Why PLC” text on the left side.</li>

<li>These are the Global Partners of the college.I removed the “Request info, Apply to PLC and FAQs” from the home to reduce repitition as two cards lead the user to the same pages again and again and Apply to PLC is already on the top of the page and in the quick links at the bottom nav.</li>

<li>Contact form for the user to contact with the college. I placed it at the bottom as I feel it to be less important than the other information on the page and centre aligned it to make the page consistent.

          <p>All the programs and courses appear as a dropdown menu when the user hover over the menu option now. It is a long list and difficult for the user to click the program as sometimes the menu disappears. I made this a different page rather than the dropdown menu options. Now the user can click on the title o open the page and see all courses and programs.</p>

<p>Quick links with the list of the data that is displayed on the page. When the user scroll down, the quick links do not appear as these scrolls with the whole page. I made the Quick links on the left to be static and will always appear to the user even if they scroll down so that they can easily switch to the content using the quick links.</p>
