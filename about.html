        <div class="work-para">
          <p>I am a Bachelorette in Computer Applications with Maths and Physics, currently pursuing my studies in Web and Moble App Design at Langara College. Other than UX Design, I like to draw, play basketball and badminton, I love to travel and make new
friends. I can proudly say that I am good in communication and making new friends.</p>

<p>When I was in my High School, I wanted to pursue something in IT field and as I have always loved to draw and sketch so it got me confused but then I heard of UX and UI which really fascinated me. I know it was not exactly drawing / sketching and IT but it gave me direction where I wanna be and I wanna see myself in the future. I love to solve problems and this is where I can help people by solving their problems through my design. </p>

<p>I am hardworking and passionate abput my work who is always ready to accept challenges. I like to get things done on time and confident enough to work within teams. I can ensure the completion of the projects on time. I always hear out to others and keep my opinion in front of others which helps the team to work together and make the projects successfull.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to new skills and improving myself throughout to give my best.</p>
